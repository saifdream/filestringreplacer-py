8-bit 
  
16 MHz 
  
AVR 
Arduino/Genuino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P ( 
datasheet 
). It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz quartz crystal, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started.. You can tinker with your UNO without worring too much about doing something wrong, worst case scenario you can replace the chip for a few dollars and start over again. 
""Uno"" means one in Italian and was chosen to mark the release of Arduino Software (IDE) 1.0. The Uno board and version 1.0 of Arduino Software (IDE) were the reference versions of Arduino, now evolved to newer releases. The Uno board is the first in a series of USB Arduino boards, and the reference model for the Arduino platform; for an extensive list of current, past or outdated boards see the Arduino index of boards. 
You can find

,simple,,Arduino Uno R3 (China),1,0,visible,,"The Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the  
ATmega328 
. It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog inputs, a 16  
MHz 
 ceramic resonator, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started. 
The Uno differs from all preceding boards in that it does not use the FTDI USB-to-serial driver chip. Instead, it features the  
Atmega16U2 
 ( 
Atmega8U2 
 up to version R2) programmed as a USB-to-serial converter. 
Revision 2 
 of the Uno board has a resistor pulling the 8U2 HWB line to ground, making it easier to put into  
DFU mode 
. 
Revision 3 
 of the board has the following new features: 
1.0 pinout: added SDA and SCL pins that are near to the AREF pin and two other new pins placed near to the RESET pin, the IOREF that allow the shields to adapt to the voltage provided from the board. In future, shields will be compatible with both the board that uses the AVR, which operates with 5V and with the Arduino Due that operates with 3.3V. The second one is a not connected pin, that is reserved for future purposes. 
Stronger RESET circuit. 
Atmega 16U2 replace the 8U2. 
""Uno"" means one in Italian and is named to mark the upcoming release of Arduino 1.0. The Uno and version 1.0 will be the reference versions of Arduino, moving forward. The Uno is the latest in a series of USB Arduino boards, and the reference model for the Arduino platform; for a comparison with previous versions, see the 
index of Arduino boards

Operating Voltage: 4V to 6V (Typically +5V) 
Operating Current: 30mA 
Range: <100m 
Works with Serial communication (USART) and TTL compatible 
Follows IEEE 802.15.1 standardized protocol 
Uses Frequency-Hopping Spread spectrum (FHSS) 
Can operate in Master, Slave or Master/Slave mode 
Can be easily interfaced with Laptop or Mobile phones with Bluetooth 
Supported baud rate: 9600,19200,38400,57600,115200,230400,460800. 
Where to use HC-05 Bluetooth module 
The  
HC-05 
 is a very cool module which can add two-way (full-duplex) wireless functionality to your projects. You can use this module to communicate between two microcontrollers like Arduino or communicate with any device with Bluetooth functionality like a Phone or Laptop. There are many android applications that are already available which makes this process a lot easier. The module communicates with the help of USART at 9600 baud rate hence it is easy to interface with any microcontroller that supports USART. We can also configure the default values of the module by using the command mode. So if you looking for a Wireless module that could transfer data from your computer or mobile phone to microcontroller or vice versa then this module might be the right choice for you. However do not expect this module to transfer multimedia like photos or songs; you might have to look into the CSR8645 module for that.

,simple,,16-Channel 12-bit PWM Servo Driver Module PCA9685 For Arduino,1,0,visible,,"Description:  
16-Channel 12-bit PWM Servo Driver – PCA9685 
Using only two pins, control 16 free-running PWM outputs! You can even chain up 62 breakouts to control up to 992 PWM outputs. 
It’s an i2c-controlled PWM driver with a built in clock. That means that, unlike the TLC5940 family, you do not need to continuously send it signal tying up your microcontroller, its completely free running! 
It is 5V compliant, which means you can control it from a 3.3V microcontroller and still safely drive up to 6V outputs (this is good for when you want to control white or blue LEDs with 3.4 forward voltages) 
6 address select pins so you can wire up to 62 of these on a single i2c bus, a total of 992 outputs – that’s a lot of servos or LEDs 
Adjustable frequency PWM up to about 1.6 KHz 
12-bit resolution for each output – for servos, that means about 4us resolution at 60Hz update rate 
Configurable push-pull or open-drain output 
Output enable pin to quickly disable all the outputs 
Includes: 
4 pieces of 3×4 male straight header (for servo/LED plugs) 
2-pin terminal block (for power) 
6-pin 0.1″ header 
Specifications: 
Dimensions (no headers or terminal block) 2.5″ x 1″ x 0.1″ (62.5mm x 25.4mm x 3mm) 
Weight (no headers or terminal block): 5.5grams 
Weight (with 3×4 headers & terminal block): 9grams 
This board/chip uses I2C 7-bit address between 0x60-0x80, selectable with jumpers

HC-06 Wireless Bluetooth Transceiver RF Main Module Serial For Arduino 
Note: This module does not suitable for IOS system. 
Description: 
The core module HC-06 main modules, leads the interface includes VCC, GND, TXD, RXD, KEY pin high trigger to clear the pairing information re search 
led indicate Bluetooth connection status, flash unpaired slow flash indicates paired but not slave connection, Always follow machine connected 
Backplate settings LDO input voltage of 3.6~~6V unpaired current is about 30mA, paired 10mA, input voltage prohibit more than 7V absolute prohibition of reverse power! 
Interface level 3.3V, can be directly connected the various SCM (51, AVR, PIC, ARM, MSP430, etc.), the 5V MCU also can be connected directly, without MAX232 can not go through the MAX232! 
Open to effective distance of 10 meters, over 10 meters is also possible, but not of this the quality of the connection of the distance do to ensure 
The pair later when full-duplex serial use, do not need to know anything about the Bluetooth protocol, but only supports 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity communication format, which is the most commonly used communication format does not support other formats. 
Support to establish a Bluetooth connection through AT commands set the baud rate, passkey, set parameters are saved after. Bluetooth connection is automatically switched to the pass-through mode.

,simple,,W5100 Ethernet Shield for Arduino,1,0,visible,,"Product Description 
The Arduino Ethernet Shield allows an Arduino board to connect to the internet. It is based on the  
Wiznet W5100 
ethernet chip ( 
datasheet 
). The Wiznet W5100 provides a network (IP) stack capable of both TCP and UDP. It supports up to four simultaneous socket connections. Use the  
Ethernet library 
 to write sketches which connect to the internet using the shield. The ethernet shield connects to an Arduino board using long wire-wrap headers which extend through the shield. This keeps the pin layout intact and allows another shield to be stacked on top. 
The Ethernet Shield has a standard RJ-45 connection, with an integrated line transformer. 
There is an onboard micro-SD card slot, which can be used to store files for serving over the network. It is compatible with the Arduino Uno and Mega (using the Ethernet library). The onboard microSD card reader is accessible through the SD Library. When working with this library, SS is on Pin 4. The original revision of the shield contained a full-size SD card slot; this is not supported. 
The shield provides a standard RJ45 ethernet jack. The reset button on the shield resets both the W5100 and the Arduino board. 
The shield contains a number of informational LEDs: 
PWR: indicates that the board and shield are powered 
LINK: indicates the presence of a network link and flashes when the shield transmits or receives data 
FULLD: indicates that the network connection is full duplex 
100M: indicates the presence of a 100 Mb/s network connection (as opposed to 10 Mb/s) 
RX: flashes when the shield receives data 
TX: flashes when the shield sends data 
COLL: flashes when network collisions are detected 
The solder jumper marked “INT” can be connected to allow the Arduino board to receive interrupt-driven notification of events from the W5100, but this is not supported by the Ethernet library. The jumper connects the INT pin of the W5100 to digital pin 2 of the Arduino.

,simple,,ULN2803 Hi-Voltage Hi-Current Darlington Array,1,0,visible,,"A ULN2803 is an Integrated Circuit (IC) chip with a High Voltage/High Current Darlington Transistor Array. It allows you to interface TTL signals with higher voltage/current loads. In English, the chip takes low level signals (TLL, CMOS, PMOS, NMOS – which operate at low voltages and low currents) and acts as a relay of sorts itself, switching on or off a higher level signal on the opposite side. 
The ULN2803 comes in an 18-pin IC configuration and includes eight (8) transistors. Pins 1-8 receive the low level signals, pin 9 is grounded (for the low level signal reference). Pin 10 is the common on the high side and would generally be connected to the positive of the voltage you are applying to the relay coil. Pins 11-18 are the outputs (Pin 1 drives Pin 18, Pin 2 drives 17, etc.). 
ULN2803 has 8 driving channels and  
each channel can withstand peak currents of 600mA. Suppression diodes are included for back EMF protection while driving inductive loads.

,simple,,Solenoid Lock 12v,1,0,visible,,"12V Solenoid Lock 
12V Solenoid lock are basically electromagnets: they are made of a big coil of copper wire with an armature (a slug of metal) in the middle. When the coil is energized, the slug is pulled into the center of the coil. This makes the solenoid able to pull from one end. 
This solenoid lock in particular is nice and strong, and has a slug with a slanted cut and a good mounting bracket. It’s basically an electronic lock, designed for a basic cabinet or safe or door. Normally the lock is active so you can’t open the door because the solenoid slug is in the way. It does not use any power in this state. When 9-12VDC is applied, the slug pulls in so it doesn’t stick out anymore and the door can be opened. 
The solenoid lock come with the slanted slug as shown above, but you can open it with the two Phillips-head screws and turn it around so its rotated 90, 180 or 270 degrees so that it matches the door you want to use it with. 
To drive a solenoid lock with an  
Arduino 
 you will need a  
relay module 
 fairly good  
power supply 
, as a lot of current will rush into the solenoid to charge up the electro-magnet, about 500mA, so  
don’t 
 try to power it with a 9V battery!

Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) Thermistors have an inverse relationship between its electrical resistance and body temperature; drop in resistance with rise in temperature and vice versa. NTC’s R/T could be considered linear over small temperature and is non-linear over larger range of temperature. R/T is repeatable and can be reproduced to exacting specifications. NTC thermistors exhibit relatively large change in resistance vs. temperature providing greater sensitivity to changes in temperature when compared to other temperature sensors, such as thermocouples and RTD's. 
You can easily calculate the resistance of NTC Thermistors at a given temperature using beta, but there is an even more accurate way to do this using the Steinhart & Hart Equation. NTC Thermistors are also an excellent alternative to semiconductor circuitry for solving temperature related problems. They can be easily used to calculate the temperature coefficient. We will provide you with guidelines for using NTC Thermistors to achieve the most accurate measurements possible.

,simple,,MAX7219CWG 8-Digit LED Display Drivers SMD,1,0,visible,,"Data Multiplexer Adds Cursor To MAX7219 or MAX7221 
LED 7 Segment Display Driver 
Jun 04, 2002 
Abstract: The MAX7219 or MAX7221 7-segment LED display driver can highlight any one digit of its 8 digit display 
by adding a data multiplexer. This circuit intensifies the brightness of the selected digit to provide a cursor function 
for data entry as well as readout. 
A data multiplexer (IC2) enables the LED-display driver in Figure 1 to highlight any selected digit by intensifying its 
brightness. This cursor function enables use of the display for data entry as well as readout. 
Page 1 of 3 
Page 2 of 3 
Figure 1. The digital multiplexer in this 8-digit display (IC2) provides a cursor function that intensifies the selected 
digit. 
The operator of an environmental chamber, for instance, can set a desired temperature by entering that value via 
the display. Four ""buttons"" are required, but are not shown: left/right for selecting the digit to be intensified, and 
up/down for changing the digit's value (the buttons can be read by a microcontroller). Driving active-low CURSOR 
high then removes the cursor effect (by disabling IC2), and allows the display to continue monitoring temperature as 
it moves toward the new set point. 
IC1 controls as many as eight 7-segment digits (eight segments including the decimal point) by scanning them 
sequentially and producing a value for each according to data stored in the chip via its serial interface. Each 
segment-driver output is a current source that delivers approximately 100 times the current entering ISET (pin 18). 
Thus, you can change the brightness of a given digit by altering the ISET current as that digit is scanned. (IC1 also 
provides a 16-level digital brightness control via 4-bit pulse-width modulation of the segment currents.) 
The corresponding segments in each digit are bused together externally. The cathodes of all LED segments in a 
digit are bused together internally, allowing the digit to be turned on by drawing current from its common node with a 
logic-zero signal. Unselected digit-driver lines remain high. The digit-scan rate is approximately 1300/second. 
When you apply a 3-bit digit-select code to IC2 while driving active-low CURSOR low, the multiplexer connects the 
corresponding digit signal to terminal Y and its complement to terminal W (pin 6). Thus, selecting a particular digit 
for cursor intensification drives W high during that digit scan, placing R1 and R3 in parallel and driving more current 
into ISET. (When W is low, R3 robs current from ISET.) If active-low CURSOR remains high, the digits exhibit 
uniform maximum brightness because W remains high for all of them. 
Each of IC1's eight digit-driver outputs can sink LED currents as high as 320mA, but these outputs remain logiccompatible 
with the digital inputs of IC2. Even at 320mA, the digit-driver output voltages remain below the 
multiplexer's guaranteed low-level input voltage (VIL). 
A related idea appeared in the 3/30/95 issue of EDN.

,simple,,CD4017,1,0,visible,,"The CD4017B is a 5-stage Johnson decade counter with ten spike-free decoded active HIGH outputs (Ooto O9), an active LOW output from the most significant flip-flop (O5-9),active HIGH and active LOW clock inputs (CP0,CP1) and an overriding asynchronous master reset input (MR).The counter is advanced by either a LOW to HIGH transition at CP0whileCP1is LOW or a HIGH to LOW transition atCP1while CP0is HIGH (see also function table).When cascading counters, theO5-9output, which is LOW while the counter is in states 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, can be used to drive the CP0input of the next counter.A HIGH on MR resets the counter to zero(Oo=O5-9= HIGH; O1to O9= LOW) independent of the clock inputs (CP0,CP1).Automatic code correction of the counter is provided by an internal circuit: following any illegal code the counter returns to a proper counting mode within 11 clock pulses.Schmitt-trigger action in the clock input makes the circuit highly tolerant to slower clock rise and fall times.

Application 
1.Use as a step-down modules with overcurrent protection 
Usage: 
(1) Adjust the right button so that“OUT”LED lighted, Digital meter shows the value of output voltage ,adjust the“voltage potentiometer”so that the output voltage reaches the value you want. 
(2) Adjust the right button so that Digital meter shows the value of output current;Wire shorted output terminal, then adjust the“current potentiometer”so that the output current reaches a predetermined overcurrent protection value. (For example, the Digital meter displays the current value of 4A, then you can use the module to a maximum current of 4A) 
(3) Connected to the load. 
2.Use as a battery charger 
Usage: 
(1) Make sure you need to charge the battery float voltage and charging current; (if lithium parameters 3.7V/2200mAh, then the float voltage is 4.2V, the maximum charging current 1C, ie 2200mA) 
(2)Under no-load conditions, adjust the“Voltage potentiometer”so that the output voltage reaches the float voltage; (if to 3.7V rechargeable lithium battery, the output voltage can be adjusted to 4.2V) 
(3)Adjust the right button so that Digital meter shows the value of output current;Wire shorted output terminal, then adjust the“current potentiometer”so that the output current reaches a predetermined Charging current value. 
(4)Charge turn lamp current factory default is 0.1 times the charging current; (Battery during charging current is gradually reduced, if the charge current setting is 1A, then when the charge current is less than 0.1A, blue lights turned off, the green light is on, which means that the battery is fullycharged) 
(5)connected to the battery charge. 
(1,2,3,4 steps as: Output is unloaded, do not connect the battery) 
3.Use as a LED constant current driver module 
Usage: 
(1)Adjust the“voltage potentiometer”so that the output voltage reaches the value you want. 
(2)Adjust the right button so that Digital meter shows the value of output current;Wire shorted output terminal, then adjust the“current potentiometer”so that the output current reaches a predetermined LED operating current. 
(3)Connect LED, work. 
(1,2 steps as: Output is unloaded, do not connect LED) 
  
Voltmeter and ammeter calibration method: 
Module with manual calibration function can correct display precision voltage and current, if you think the current voltage and current accuracy to meet the requirements, do not perform the following operations. 
(1) Output voltage calibration steps 
Step 1, adjust the right button so that“OUT”LED lighted, Digital meter shows the value of output voltage; Press the right button for more than 2 seconds, release, Digital meter and“OUT”LED flashes in synchronization so that you enter the output voltage calibration mode. 
Step 2, press the right button (normal speed), the voltage value is adding up a unit; Press the left button, minus a unit; Due to a unit is less than 0.1V, the minimum voltage display to 0.1V, so you need to continuously press 1-5 times to see the voltmeter change 0.1V, how many times voltmeter change 0.1V by pressing the key, depending on the current display voltage, the higher the voltage, the fewer the number of press. 
Step 3, press the right button for more than 2 seconds, release, to exit the output voltage calibration mode. All parameters set to automatically power down to save. 
(2) Input voltage calibration steps 
Step 1, adjust the right button so that“IN”LED lighted, Digital meter shows the value of input voltage; press the right button for more than 2 seconds, release, Digital meter and“IN”LED flashes in synchronization so that you enter the input voltage calibration mode. 
Steps 2 and 3, consistent with the output voltage calibration method. 
(3)Output current calibration steps 
Step 1, adjust the right button so that Digital meter shows the value of output Current. Press the right button for more than 2 seconds, release, Digital meter flashes in synchronization so that you enter the output current calibration mode. 
Step 2,Connected to the load, ammeter in series, adjust the right and left button to change the display of digital meter, so that is consistent with the ammeter display .

,simple,,Grove - Water Sensor,1,0,visible,,"Grove water sensor module 
 is part of the Twig system. This sensor works by having a series of exposed traces connected to ground and interlaced between the grounded traces are the sens traces. The sensor traces have a weak pull-up resistor of 1 MΩ. The resistor will pull the sensor trace value high until a drop of water shorts the sensor trace to the grounded trace. Believe it or not this circuit will work with the digital I/O pins of your Arduino or you can use it with the analog pins to detect the amount of water induced contact between the grounded and sensor traces.

5V 
  
8-bit 
  
16 MHz 
  
AVR 
Arduino/Genuino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P ( 
datasheet 
). It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz quartz crystal, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started.. You can tinker with your UNO without worring too much about doing something wrong, worst case scenario you can replace the chip for a few dollars and start over again. 
""Uno"" means one in Italian and was chosen to mark the release of Arduino Software (IDE) 1.0. The Uno board and version 1.0 of Arduino Software (IDE) were the reference versions of Arduino, now evolved to newer releases. The Uno board is the first in a series of USB Arduino boards, and the reference model for the Arduino platform; for an extensive list of current, past or outdated boards see the Arduino index of boards. 
You can find 
  
here 
  
your board warranty informations. 
Getting Started 
You can find in the 
  
Getting Started section 
  
all the information you need to configure your board, use the Arduino So ftware (IDE), and start tinker with coding and electronics.

,simple,,LM358 - Op-Amp (Through-Hole),1,0,visible,,"Description: 
 The LM358 is a great, easy-to-use dual-channel opamp. Opamps have so many  
applications 
 we figured we should probably carry at least one in a DIP package. LM358 applications include transducer amplifiers, DC gain blocks and all the conventional opamp circuits. 
If you’re looking for a good, standard opamp the LM358 should fill most of your needs. It can handle a supply of 3-32VDC and source up to 20mA per channel. This opamp is great if you need to operate two individual opamps from a single power supply. Comes in an 8-pin DIP package. 
Features: 
Two internally compensated op-amps 
Internally frequency compensated for unity gain 
Large DC voltage gain: 100 dB 
Wide bandwidth (unity gain): 1 MHz (temperature compensated) 
Wide power supply range: 
Single supply: 3V to 32V 
or dual supplies: +/-1.5V to +/-16V

,simple,,USBASP AVR Programmer,1,0,visible,,"These AVR programmers are based on  
Thomas Fischl's 
 USBasp design and connect to your computer's USB port. Not only are they quite compact (70x20mm), but the design is really elegant. The USB interface is achieved by using an atmega8 processor and the rest is done in firmware. 
Being an Open source hardware (OSHW) project, released under the GNU General Public License, you are free to download the schematic and firmware from Thomas's website, but then you have a chicken and egg problem. In order to load the USBASP firmware onto the atmega8 on the programmer, yes you guessed it, you need an AVR programmer. Much easier to buy one fully built and programmed. 
Some of the features include: 
Allows you to read or write the microcontroller EEPROM, firmware, fuse bits and lock bits 
Support for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux (will work on Windows 8.1) 
5 KB/sec maximum write speed 
Software controlled SCK option to support targets with low clock speed (< 1.5MHz) 
10 pin ISP interface (conforms to standard ISP 10-pin pinout) 
The latest  
Window Drivers 
 are fully signed, so you can use them on Windows Vista and above without any issues. The driver will work on both 32 and 64 bit platforms. On Linux And Mac OS X no kernel driver is required, just use AVRdude and specify the correct port. 
The programmer will work with a wide variety of Atmel AVR microcontrollers including the  
Atmega8a 
 and  
Atmega168a 
. A full list is available on the specifications tab. The programmer will also work with a variety of software including 
AVRdude 
 - Version 5.2 or later. AVRdude is available for many platforms. 
Khazama AVR Programmer 
 - An AVRdude GUI for MS Windows 
BASCOM-AVR 
 - Version 1.11.9.6 or later 
eXtreme Burner 
 - An easy to use GUI application for MS Windows. 
Included with the programmer is a 10 pin ISP cable, as shown in the main photo. The programmer is ideal for use with our  
AVR development board and kits 
. 
At Protostack we like to eat our own dogfood, so we use the USBASP programmers extensively. Every one of our AVR tutorials was done using a USBASP programmer. We really like them and hope you will too.

    Python 
On Windows you need install Python 2.7.10. 
On Linux & MAC OSX, you don't need install it, comes preinstalled with OS. 
    Installing Hardware package 
There is two ways to install hardware package, Boards Manager or GIT 
    Installing with Boards Manager 
Starting with 1.6.4,for Arduino allows installation of third-party platform packages using 
Boards Manager. We have packages available for Windows, Mac OS, and Linux (32 and 
64 bit). 
<1>. Install for Arduino 1.6.7 from the for Arduino website. 
<2>. Start for Arduino and open Preferences window. 
<3> 
into Additional Boards Manager URLs field. You can add multiple URLs, separating them 
with commas. 
<4>. Open Tools→Board:xxx→Boards Manager and install esp8266 by ESP8266 
Community (and don't forget to select your ESP8266 board from Tools > Board menu 
after installation).

,simple,,16-Channel 12-bit PWM Servo Driver Module PCA9685 For Arduino,1,0,visible,,"Description:  
16-Channel 12-bit PWM Servo Driver – PCA9685 
Using only two pins, control 16 free-running PWM outputs! You can even chain up 62 breakouts to control up to 992 PWM outputs. 
It’s an i2c-controlled PWM driver with a built in clock. That means that, unlike the TLC5940 family, you do not need to continuously send it signal tying up your microcontroller, its completely free running! 
It is 5V compliant, which means you can control it from a 3.3V microcontroller and still safely drive up to 6V outputs (this is good for when you want to control white or blue LEDs with 3.4 forward voltages) 
6 address select pins so you can wire up to 62 of these on a single i2c bus, a total of 992 outputs – that’s a lot of servos or LEDs 
Adjustable frequency PWM up to about 1.6 KHz 
12-bit resolution for each output – for servos, that means about 4us resolution at 60Hz update rate 
Configurable push-pull or open-drain output 
Output enable pin to quickly disable all the outputs 
Includes: 
4 pieces of 3×4 male straight header (for servo/LED plugs) 
2-pin terminal block (for power) 
6-pin 0.1″ header 
Specifications: 
Dimensions (no headers or terminal block) 2.5″ x 1″ x 0.1″ (62.5mm x 25.4mm x 3mm) 
Weight (no headers or terminal block): 5.5grams 
Weight (with 3×4 headers & terminal block): 9grams 
This board/chip uses I2C 7-bit address between 0x60-0x80, selectable with jumpers

Advantage: 
CC CV 
Low ripple 
When the module charges a battery, it first use constant current to protect the battery. check the curse above. 
Applications: 
1. Use as a step-down modules with overcurrent protection capabilities. 
    Usage: 
Adjust the “voltage potentiometer” so that the output voltage reaches the value you want. 
Use a multimeter to measure the output short-circuit current with 10A stalls, while regulating the “current potentiometer” so that the output current reaches a predetermined overcurrent protection value. (For example, the meter displays the current value of 4A, then you can use the module to a maximum current of 4A) 
Connected to the load. 
2. Use as a battery charger. 
    Usage: 
Make sure you need to charge the battery float voltage and charging current; (if lithium parameters 3.7V/2200mAh, then the float voltage is 4.2V, the maximum charging current 1C, ie 2200mA) 
Under no-load conditions, adjust the “Voltage potentiometer” so that the output voltage reaches the float voltage; (if to 3.7V rechargeable lithium battery, the output voltage can be adjusted to 4.2V) 
Use a multimeter to measure the output short-circuit current with 10A stalls, while regulating the “current potentiometer” so that the output current reaches a predetermined Charging current value. 
Charge turn lamp current factory default is 0.1 times the charging current; (Battery during charging current is gradually reduced, if the charge current setting is 1A, then when the charge current is less than 0.1A, blue lights turned off, the green light is on, which means that the battery is fully charged) 
Connected to the battery charge. 
(1,2,3,4 steps as: Output is unloaded, do not connect the battery) 
3. Use as a LED constant current driver module. 
    Usage: 
Adjust the “voltage potentiometer” so that the output voltage reaches the value you want. 
Use a multimeter to measure the output short-circuit current with 10A stalls, while regulating the “current potentiometer” so that the output current reaches a predetermined LED operating current. 
Connect LED, work.

The chip can be configured as 4 single-ended input channels, or two differential channels. As a nice bonus, it even includes a programmable gain amplifier, up to x16, to help boost up smaller single/differential signals to the full range. We like this ADC because it can run from 2V to 5V power/logic, can measure a large range of signals and its super easy to use. It is a great general purpose 16 bit converter. 
  
The chip's fairly small so it comes on a breakout board with ferrites to keep the AVDD and AGND quiet. Interfacing is done via I2C. The address can be changed to one of four options (see the datasheet table 5) so you can have up to 4 ADS1115's connected on a single 2-wire I2C bus for 16 single ended inputs.

,simple,,16 MHz - CRYSTAL OSCILLATOR,1,0,visible,,"It provide clock pulses of 16 Mhz frequency. 
  
It can be used as UART clock (6×1.8432 MHz). 
  
It allows integer division to common baud rates (96×115200 baud or 96×96×1,200 baud). 
  
It is a common clock for AVR microcontroller 
  
It uses the mechanical resonance of a vibrating crystal of piezoelectric material to create an electrical signal with a very precise frequency. 
  
This frequency is commonly used to keep track of time, to provide a stable clock signal for digital integrated circuits, and to stabilize frequencies for radio transmitters and receivers. 
  
The most common type of piezoelectric resonator used is the quartz crystal, so oscillator circuits incorporating them became known as crystal oscillators. 
  
The crystal oscillator circuit sustains oscillation by taking a voltage signal from the quartz resonator, amplifying it, and feeding it back to the resonator. 
  
The rate of expansion and contraction of the quartz is the resonant frequency, and is determined by the cut and size of the crystal. When the energy of the generated output frequencies matches the losses in the circuit, an oscillation can be sustained. 
  
One of the most important traits of the crystal oscillator is that it exhibits very low phase noise. 
  
In the crystal oscillator, the crystal mostly vibrates in one axis, therefore only one phase is dominant. This property of low phase noise makes them particularly useful in telecommunications where stable signals are needed, and in scientific equipment where very precise time references are needed. The result is that a quartz crystal behaves like a circuit composed of an inductor,capacitor and resistor, with a precise resonant frequency 
FEATURES AND USAGE 
The crystal oscillator circuit sustains oscillation by taking a voltage signal from the quartz resonator, amplifying it, and feeding it back to the resonator 
It provides clock pulses of 16 MHz frequency. 
The popularity of the crystals is due to low cost.

,simple,,Arduino Nano,1,0,visible,,"Understanding Arduino Nano 
The Arduino board is designed in such a way that it is very easy for beginners to get started with microcontrollers. This board especially is breadboard friendly is very easy to handle the connections. Let’s start with powering the Board. 
Powering you Arduino Nano: 
There are totally three ways by which you can power your Nano. 
USB Jack: 
 Connect the mini USB jack to a phone charger or computer through a cable and it will draw power required for the board to function  
Vin Pin:  
The Vin pin can be supplied with a unregulated 6-12V to power the board. The on-board voltage regulator regulates it to +5V 
+5V Pin:  
If you have a regulated +5V supply then you can directly provide this o the +5V pin of the Arduino. 
  
Input/output: 
There are totally 14 digital Pins and 8 Analog pins on your Nano board. The digital pins can be used to interface sensors by using them as input pins or drive loads by using them as output pins. A simple function like pinMode() and digitalWrite() can be used to control their operation. The operating voltage is 0V and 5V for digital pins. The analog pins can measure analog voltage from 0V to 5V using any of the 8 Analog pins using a simple function liken analogRead() 
These pins apart from serving their purpose can also be used for special purposes which are discussed below: 
Serial Pins 0 (Rx) and 1 (Tx): 
 Rx and Tx pins are used to receive and transmit TTL serial data. They are connected with the corresponding ATmega328P USB to TTL serial chip. 
External Interrupt Pins 2 and 3: 
 These pins can be configured to trigger an interrupt on a low value, a rising or falling edge, or a change in value. 
PWM Pins 3, 5, 6, 9 and 11: 
 These pins provide an 8-bit PWM output by using analogWrite() function. 
SPI Pins 10 (SS), 11 (MOSI), 12 (MISO) and 13 (SCK): 
 These pins are used for SPI communication. 
In-built LED Pin 13: 
 This pin is connected with an built-in LED, when pin 13 is HIGH – LED is on and when pin 13 is LOW, its off. 
I2C A4 (SDA) and A5 (SCA): 
 Used for IIC communication using Wire library. 
AREF: 
 Used to provide reference voltage for analog inputs with analogReference() function. 
  
Reset Pin:  
Making this pin LOW, resets the microcontroller. 
  
These special functions and their respective pins are illustrated in the  
arduino nano pin diagram 
 shown above. 
  
How to use Arduino Nano 
It will hardly take 5-10 minutes to  
upload you first program to Arduino Nano 
.All you need the Arduino IDE an USB cable and your Nano board itself.

Ferric Chloride is inorganic macromolecular coagulant, which is made by polyaluminum chloride complexing with polymeric. Therefore, the molecular structure is enlarged; the capacity of neutralization and bridging adsorption is enhanced. It is an ideal chemical to treat heavily organic-polluted raw water as well as low-temperature and low-turbidity, low-temperature and high-turbidity water. 
Properties 
Ferric Chloride combines the coagulate advantages of aluminum salt and ferric salt; can lead to quick formation of close flocs and rapid precipitation. 
Ferric Chloride has wide-range adaptability to the waters at different temperatures and a good solubility. 
The dosage is smaller than that of other flocculants, which is better for improving the quality of treated water. 
It is suitable for the automatic dosing.

Ferric Chloride is inorganic macromolecular coagulant, which is made by polyaluminum chloride complexing with polymeric. Therefore, the molecular structure is enlarged; the capacity of neutralization and bridging adsorption is enhanced. It is an ideal chemical to treat heavily organic-polluted raw water as well as low-temperature and low-turbidity, low-temperature and high-turbidity water. 
Properties 
Ferric Chloride combines the coagulate advantages of aluminum salt and ferric salt; can lead to quick formation of close flocs and rapid precipitation. 
Ferric Chloride has wide-range adaptability to the waters at different temperatures and a good solubility. 
The dosage is smaller than that of other flocculants, which is better for improving the quality of treated water. 
It is suitable for the automatic dosing.

,simple,,Ardupilot APM 2.8 Flight Controller with Built-in Compass,1,0,visible,,"APM 2.8 Multicopter Flight Controller is upgraded version of 2.5 2.6 with Built-in Compass for FPV RC Drone Aircraft is the new APM 2.8 flight controller. The sensors are exactly the same as the APM 2.6 flight controller, however, this has the option to use the built-in compass, or an external compass via a jumper. This makes the APM 2.8 ideal for use with multi-copters and rovers. 
The APM 2.8 Multicopter Flight Controller is a complete open source autopilot system and the bestselling technology that won the prestigious Outback Challenge UAV competition. It allows the user to turn any fixed, rotary wing or multirotor vehicle (even cars and boats) into a fully autonomous vehicle; capable of performing programmed GPS missions with waypoints. 
This revision of the board has an optional onboard compass, which is designed for vehicles (especially multi-copters and rovers) where the compass should be placed as far from power and motor sources as possible to avoid magnetic interference. (On fixed wing aircraft it’s often easier to mount APM far enough away from the motors and ESCs to avoid magnetic interference, so this is not as critical, but APM 2.8 gives more flexibility in that positioning and is a good choice for them, too). This is designed to be used with the 3DR uBlox GPS with Compass so that the GPS/Compass unit can be mounted further from noise sources than APM itself. 
APM 2.8 Multicopter Flight Controller requires a GPS unit for full autonomy. You can add additional extras to your AMP 2.8 board via the options above. 
Using the built-in compass 
To use the built-in compass simply connect the jumper as shown below.  If the compass jumper is removed then the APM board will use the external compass which is best for multirotor with a GPS/compass module mounted externally

Phase Control Thyristors, NXP Semiconductors 
Thyristors - NXP Semiconductors 
A Thyristor is a solid-state semiconductor device with four layers of alternating N and P-type material. They act as bistable switches, conducting when their gate receives a current trigger, and continue to conduct while they are forward biased. Thyristors are synonymous to Silicon-Controlled Rectifier (SCR).

,simple,,Arduino Mega 2560 R3 Made in Italy,1,0,visible,,"The Arduino Mega is a microcontroller board based on the  
ATmega2560 
. It has 54 digital input/output pins (of which 14 can be used as PWM outputs), 16 analog inputs, 4  
UARTs 
 (hardware serial ports), a 16  
MHz 
 crystal oscillator, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started. The Mega is compatible with most shields designed for the Arduino Duemilanove or Diecimila. The Mega 2560 R3 also adds SDA and SCL pins next to the AREF. In addition, there are two new pins placed near the RESET pin. One is the IOREF that allow the shields to adapt to the voltage provided from the board. The other is a not connected and is reserved for future purposes. The Mega 2560 R3 works with all existing shields but can adapt to new shields which use these additional pins.

,simple,,"Thermoelectric Cooler ( Peltier ) TEC1-12706, 40x40mm",1,0,visible,,"Description: 
 Thermoelectric coolers (TEC or Peltier) create a temperature differential on each side. One side gets hot and the other side gets cool. Therefore, they can be used to either warm something up or cool something down, depending on which side you use. You can also take advantage of a temperature differential to generate electricity. The thermal tape listed below works very well to attach heat sinks to the hot side. 
This Peltier works very well as long as you remove the heat from the hot side. After turning on the device, the hot side will heat quickly, the cold side will cool quickly. If you do not remove the heat from the hot side (with a heat sink or other device), the Peltier will quickly reach stasis and do nothing. We recommend using an old computer CPU heatsink or other block of metal to pull heat from the hot side. We were able to use a computer power supply and CPU heatsink to make the cold side so uncomfortable we could not hold our finger to it. 
Note: 
 It is imperative that a heat sink is used on the hot side of the module. Running the module without one can cause damage to this part. If it’s too hot to comfortably touch, you’re in the danger zone!

Operating voltage: +5V 
Theoretical  Measuring Distance: 2cm to 450cm 
Practical Measuring Distance: 2cm to 80cm 
Accuracy: 3mm 
Measuring angle covered: <15° 
Operating Current: <15mA

HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor - Working 
As shown above the  
HC-SR04 Ultrasonic (US) sensor 
 is a 4 pin module, whose pin names are Vcc, Trigger, Echo and Ground respectively. This sensor is a very popular sensor used in many applications where measuring distance or sensing objects are required. The module has two eyes like projects in the front which forms the Ultrasonic transmitter and Receiver. The sensor works with the simple high school formula that 
Distance = Speed × Time 
How to use the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor 
HC-SR04 distance sensor 
 is commonly used with both microcontroller and microprocessor platforms like Arduino, ARM, PIC, Raspberry Pie etc. The following guide is universally since it has to be followed irrespective of the type of computational device used. 
  Power the Sensor using a regulated +5V through the Vcc ad Ground pins of the sensor. The current consumed by the sensor is less than 15mA and hence can be directly powered by the on board 5V pins (If available). The Trigger and the Echo pins are both I/O pins and hence they can be connected to I/O pins of the microcontroller. To start the measurement, the trigger pin has to be made high for 10uS and then turned off. This action will trigger an ultrasonic wave at frequency of 40Hz from the transmitter and the receiver will wait for the wave to return. Once the wave is returned after it getting reflected by any object the Echo pin goes high for a particular amount of time which will be equal to the time taken for the wave to return back to the sensor. 
The amount of time during which the Echo pin stays high is measured by the MCU/MPU as it gives the information about the time taken for the wave to return back to the Sensor. Using this information the distance is measured as explained in the above heading. 
Applications 
Used to avoid and detect obstacles with robots like biped robot, obstacle avoider robot, path finding robot etc. 
Used to measure the distance within a wide range of 2cm to 400cm 
Can be used to map the objects surrounding the sensor by rotating it 
Depth of certain places like wells, pits etc can be measured since the waves can penetrate through water

,simple,,Adafruit 16-Channel 12-bit PWM/Servo Shield - I2C interface,1,0,visible,,"Product Description 
Using only two I2C pins, control 16 free-running PWM outputs! You can even stack up 62 shields to control up to 992 PWM outputs (which we would really like to see since it would be glorious and like 4 feet tall) Because I2C is a shared bus you can also connect other I2C devices and sensors to the SCL/SDA pins as long as their addresses don't conflict (this shield has address 0x40) There's an I2C-controlled PWM driver with a built in clock. That means that, unlike the TLC5940 family, you do not need to continuously send it signal tying up your microcontroller, its completely free running! It is 5V compliant, which means you can control it from a 3.3V Arduino and still safely drive up to 6V outputs (this is good for when you want to control white or blue LEDs with 3.4+ forward voltages) 6 address select pins so you can stack up to 62 of these on a single i2c bus, a total of 992 outputs - that's a lot of servos or LEDs 3 pin connectors in groups of 4 so you can plug in 16 servos at once (Servo plugs are slightly wider than 0.1"" so you can only stack 4 next to each other on 0.1"" header Stackable design. You'll need to pick up stacking headers and right angle 3x4 headers in order to stack on top of this shield without the servo connections getting in the way. A spot to place a big capacitor on the V+ line (in case you need it) 220 ohm series resistors on all the output lines to protect them, and to make driving LEDs trivial A lot of extra space remaining? Let's turn it into a prototyping area. You get a 5x20 proto area for any extra wiring you'd like to add This product comes with a fully tested and assembled shield as well as 4 pieces of 3x4 male straight header (for servo/LED plugs), a 2-pin terminal block (for power) and a stick of 0.1"" header so you can plug into an Arduino. A little light soldering will be required to assemble and customize the board by attaching the desired headers but it is a 15 minute task that even a beginner can do.

,simple,,Solenoid 6V Small,1,0,visible,,"Solenoids are basically electromagnets: they are made of a big coil of copper wire with an armature (a slug of metal) in the middle. When the coil is energized, the slug is pulled into the center of the coil. This makes the solenoid able to pull (from one end) or push (from the other).  
This solenoid in particular is fairly small, with a 30mm long body and a 'captive' armature with a return spring. This means that when activated with up to 6VDC, the solenoid moves and when the voltage is removed it springs back to the original position, which is quite handy. Many lower cost solenoids are only push type or only pull type and may not have a captive armature (it'll fall out!) or don't have a return spring. This one even has nice mounting holes, its a great all-purpose solenoid. 
To drive a solenoid from an Arduino or any other microcontroller, you will need a power transistor and a diode. You can also use our relay boards to control the solenoid from an Arduino. You will need a fairly good power supply to drive a solenoid, as a lot of current will rush into the solenoid to charge up the electro-magnet, about 100mA, so don't try to power it with a 9V battery!

,simple,,12 MHz - CRYSTAL OSCILLATOR,1,0,visible,,"ABOUT 
  
It provide clock pulses of 12 Mhz frequency. 
  
It can be used as UART clock (6×1.8432 MHz). 
  
It allows integer division to common baud rates (96×115200 baud or 96×96×1,200 baud). 
  
It is a common clock for AVR microcontroller 
  
It uses the mechanical resonance of a vibrating crystal of piezoelectric material to create an electrical signal with a very precise frequency. 
  
This frequency is commonly used to keep track of time, to provide a stable clock signal for digital integrated circuits, and to stabilize frequencies for radio transmitters and receivers. 
  
The most common type of piezoelectric resonator used is the quartz crystal, so oscillator circuits incorporating them became known as crystal oscillators. 
  
The crystal oscillator circuit sustains oscillation by taking a voltage signal from the quartz resonator, amplifying it, and feeding it back to the resonator. 
  
The rate of expansion and contraction of the quartz is the resonant frequency, and is determined by the cut and size of the crystal. When the energy of the generated output frequencies matches the losses in the circuit, an oscillation can be sustained. 
  
One of the most important traits of the crystal oscillator is that it exhibits very low phase noise. 
  
In the crystal oscillator, the crystal mostly vibrates in one axis, therefore only one phase is dominant. This property of low phase noise makes them particularly useful in telecommunications where stable signals are needed, and in scientific equipment where very precise time references are needed. The result is that a quartz crystal behaves like a circuit composed of an inductor,capacitor and resistor, with a precise resonant frequency 
FEATURES AND USAGE 
The crystal oscillator circuit sustains oscillation by taking a voltage signal from the quartz resonator, amplifying it, and feeding it back to the resonator 
It provides clock pulses of 12 MHz frequency. 
The popularity of the crystals is due to low cost.

,simple,,Color Sensor Recognition Module,1,0,visible,,"Designed around 4 White LEDs and the TAOS TCS230 sensor IC. The four white LED’s to provide a broad spectrum light source .The TCS230 has an 8 x 8 array of photodiodes with color filters (16 Red, 16 Blue, 16 Green, 16 Clear). A light to frequency converter generates a 50% duty cycle square wave on the output pin. Frequency is directly proportional to light intensity. Output scaling 100%, 20% and 2% allows for wide dynamic range of intensities. The color selects (S2, S3), frequency scale (S0, S1) and output are TTL logic level and can be connected directly to the micro controller. Basic readings are easy using the Arduino “pulsein” command. Take a reading for each color. The reading with narrowest pulse width or highest frequency is the major color. Using advanced ratio analysis almost any color could be recognized. Multiple uses by adding lenses, color filters, different light source.

These FETs can switch over 33A and 100V and are TO-220 package so they fit nicely into any breadboard or perfboard. Heat sinking is easy with TO-220's, but because of the very low Rds(on) of down to 44 milliohm (depending on the Vgs - check the datasheet) you can get away with no heatsinking for pretty high loads! The threshhold voltage is also very low, less than 2.5V so you can control it directly from a microcontroller running on 5V logic.

,simple,,Arduino Due R3,1,0,visible,,"DESCRIPTION 
Put your Arduino project on TURBO mode with the high-speed, high-power Arduino Due! The Due cranks it up to 11 with an 84 MHz ARM core processor - 512K of FLASH storage! 96K of RAM! Both USB client and host! The Arduino Due is ideal for those who want to build projects that require high computing power. For example, remotely-controlled drones that, in order to fly, need to process a lot of sensor data per second - or an audio player that uses the built in Digital-to-Analog converter. 
The Arduino Due also gives students the opportunity to learn the inner workings of the ARM processor in a cheaper and much simpler way than before. 
To scientific projects, which need to acquire data quickly and accurately, Arduino Due provides a platform to create open source tools that are much more advanced than those available now. 
The new platform enables the open source digital fabrication community (3d Printers, Laser cutters, CNC milling machines) to achieve higher resolutions and faster speed with fewer components than in the past. 
Main features of Arduino Due 
The board is equipped with a SAM3X8E processor from Atmel, based on the 32 bit ARM Cortex M3 architecture running at 84MHz. 
USB 2.0 interface running at 480 Megabits that allows Arduino Due to act as a USB Host (so you can interface it to USB devices like mice, keyboards, cameras, mobile phones and more). Arduino Due supports the Android ADK 2012 protocol. 
12 analog inputs (ADC) with 12-bit resolution and high speed, opening the door to audio applications and signal processing projects that were impossible with Arduino Uno. 
High-resolution Analog outputs (DAC). The board provides two 12-bit outputs that can be used to generate audio signals. The Arduino Due software comes with software examples for a WAV and OGG player. 
4 high-speed serial communication ports. 
70 input/output pins. 
High-speed CAN interface. The CAN protocol is used in the automotive industry to network the different components of the car, is now becoming popular in the field of industrial automation thanks to its speed and ability to withstand electrical noise. 
12 PWM channels. 
2 I2C bus.
